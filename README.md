I don't have any knowledge of web development, i have started from scratch. I was so passionate towards it so i saw some videos but these videos didn't help me. then i google the particular tags and started understanding them but i still didn't get it properly. 
i have faces many challenges in making this project. that putting image in the centre of the page was very difficult. i still didn't know about it i will learn it.
i learn the diifferent tags and attributes in from many websites like geeksforgeeks and w3school.
i also take some references from different you tube channels.
